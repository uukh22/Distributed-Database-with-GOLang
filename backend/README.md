# Distributed Database Management System

This project is a **Golang-based distributed backend system** for managing MySQL clusters with support for **sharding**, **replication**, **automatic failover**, and **RESTful CRUD operations**.

---

## Highlights

* Master/Slave node architecture
* Automatic master election on failure
* Horizontal sharding support
* MySQL replication via binary logs and HTTP fallback
* Health checks and heartbeat system
* Foreign key support for table linkage
* RESTful API for database/table/record management
* Graceful shutdown and online recovery of nodes

---

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Libraries:**

  * [`gorilla/mux`](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
  * [`go-sql-driver/mysql`](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)

## Directory Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go              # Application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json          # Node configuration file
```

---

## Configuration File

Create a `config.json` with the following:

```json
{
  "self_url": "http://localhost:8080",
  "master_url": "http://localhost:8080",
  "shard_count": 3,
  "mysql": {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "yourpassword",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "3306"
  },
  "replication": {
    "user": "replica",
    "password": "replica_password"
  }
}
```

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. **Run node:**

   ```bash
   go run .
   ```
4. **Override config (optional):**

   ```bash
   go run main.go http://this-node:port http://master-node:port
   ```

## Node Roles

* **Master Node:**

  * Handles writes
  * Coordinates replication
  * Manages cluster state and elections

* **Slave Node:**

  * Performs read-only queries
  * Listens for replication from master

When a master node fails, the system promotes the oldest healthy slave to master.

## Sample API Usage

**Create Table Example:**

```json
POST /api/create-table
{
  "dbName": "school",
  "tableName": "students",
  "shardKey": "student_id",
  "columns": {
    "student_id": "INT",
    "name": "VARCHAR(255)",
    "age": "INT"
  }
}
```

---

## Graceful Shutdown

To shut down a node gracefully:

```bash
POST /api/shutdown
```
